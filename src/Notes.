Reflect on the code that you just added. 
	I added code that allows ADMIN to edit users, but does not allow the same function for regular USERS.
	
What do you understand? What parts do you still not understand? 
	I don't 100% understand what @service does.

What questions do you have? 
	What is the exact function of @service?

How has the app changed?
ADMIN can edit users, regular users can not, they can only view profiles.
